            <h3>What is climate change</h3>
            <p>Observed changes over the 20th century include increases in global air and ocean temperature, rising
                global sea levels, long-term sustained widespread reduction of snow and ice cover, and changes in
                atmospheric and ocean circulation as well as regional weather patterns, which influence seasonal
                rainfall conditions. These changes are caused by extra heat in the climate system due to the addition of
                greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. These additional greenhouse gases are primarily input by human
                activities such as the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, agriculture,
                and land-use changes. These activities increase the amount of ‘heat-trapping’ greenhouse gases in the
                atmosphere. The pattern of observed changes in the climate system is consistent with an increased
                greenhouse effect. Other climatic influences such as volcanoes, the sun and natural variability cannot
                alone explain the timing and extent of the observed changes.</p>

        <div class="right">
            <h3>What are the consequences</h3>
            <p>More frequent and intense drought, storms, heat waves, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and warming
                oceans can directly harm animals, destroy the places they live, and wreak havoc on people's livelihoods
                and communities. As climate change worsens, dangerous weather events are becoming more frequent or
                severe.</p>

                <img src="/recources/images/environmentalMonitoring.png">
                <p>Environmental monitoring is a tool to assess environmental conditions and trends, support policy
                    development and its implementation, and develop information for reporting to national policymakers,
                    international forums and the public.</p>

                <img src="/recources/images/smartHome.png">
                <p>Smart homes combat climate change by enhancing energy efficiency, reducing waste, and integrating
                    renewable energy sources. Automation and real-time monitoring minimize carbon emissions, making
                    smart
                    homes an eco-friendly choice for homeowners who aim to reduce their environmental impact and
                    contribute
                    to a sustainable future.</p>

                <img src="/recources/images/smartGrid.png">
                <p> IoT enables the creation of smart grids, which allow for real-time communication and data exchange
                    between utility companies and consumers. These grids can balance energy supply and demand,
                    integrating
                    renewable energy sources more efficiently and reducing the reliance on fossil fuels.</p>
